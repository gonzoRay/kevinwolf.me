# Hello!

My name is **Kevin Wolf** and I am a **Full Stack Developer** from **San Jos√©, Costa Rica**.

I currently work as a **Technology Lead** at [The Hangar](https://thehangar.cr), helping teams deliver high quality and performant experiences.

I have strong experience working with technologies like **React**, **React Native**, **Amazon Web Services**, **EOS** and more.

If you have a development team that you want to **level up** on any of the above technologies, feel free to [contact me](mailto:hi@kevinwolf.me), I offer workshops as well.
